# the8puzzleanditsheuristics
Hey!
This is a small project on the eight puzzle and the many heuristics it works with.
The example used in the notebook is chosen because it encounters many nodes, so comparing the heuristics becomes easier. I have tried my best to present my reasoning and conclusions in the notebook.
I hope it helps!
